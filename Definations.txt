Constructor
----------------------
A special method
It is used to initialize a data of a variable.
It helps to create an object
Constructor-Name is Same as a Class-Name
1-Class can have many Constructors
Every Class requires a constructor if we want to ceate the instance of that class. (else compiler will create it)

Types:
---------------
i.Implicit/Default Constructor 
•	Has no Parameter
•	Automatically created by the CLR.
•	Public
ii.No-Parameterized Constructor
•	Has no Parameter
•	Created by the User.
iii.Explicit/Parameterized Constructor
•	Has at-least 1 Parameter
•	Helps if we forget to pass any value to a variable.
iv. Copy Constructor
•	If we want to create multiple instances with the same values
•	Parameterized Constructor
•	Has  Parameter of same Class Type
v.Static Constructor
•	Static Keyword is used to create this constructor.
•	Initializes static variables.
•	Always implicitly called.
•	It executes first, even before the main method & class members, of the class. (if the 	main method is in that class.)
•	It has no Parameter. Always implicitly called, so no chance to pass a value of a 	parameter. 
•	No Parameter, so overloading is not possible.
•	It has no Access-Modifier
•	Class Name is used to call it.
•	Static members will load inside the Static Memory.

vii.Private Constructor
•	Private Keyword is used to create this constructor
•	It prevents Object-Creation
•	It prevents Inheritance
