Why Constructor? 
-------------------------

Every class requires a constructor to ba presenter init if we want to create the instance of that class.
Every class contains an implicit constructor if not defined explicitly and with the help of that implicit constructor instance of class can be created.

Why Explicitly define a constructor again?
Implicit constructors of a class will initiaze variables of a class with the same value even if we create multiple instance of that class.
If we define constructors  explicitly with parameters then we get a change of initializing the fields or variables of the class with a new value every time we going to create instance of that class.
Whenever we define a class first identfy whether if the class variables requires some values to execute and if the class variables requires some values to execute and  if they are required then define a constructor explicitly and pass values t o the constructor, so everytime the instance is created, we get a chance of passing new values.
